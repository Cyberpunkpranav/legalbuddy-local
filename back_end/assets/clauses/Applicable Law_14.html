Except for remedies available at law or in equity and except as specifically provided in this Agreement, indemnification under this Article IX is Buyer’s sole remedy for claims that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement. Damages for which the Indemnifying Parties shall be liable shall not include special, incidental or punitive damages (except to the extent such Damages are payable to a third party).</p><p>9.4 Escrow.</p><p>(a) At the Closing, Buyer will deposit the Escrow Amount, without any act of Seller, with the Escrow Agent, such deposit to constitute an escrow fund (the “<i><strong>Escrow Fund</strong></i>”) to</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-36-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>be governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Cash may be invested as jointly directed in writing by Buyer and Seller from time to time. In the absence of joint written instructions, the Escrow Cash shall be invested by the Escrow Agent in a U.S. Bank, National Association, money market deposit account, as more fully described on Exhibit L hereto. Any interest, earnings and income (including dividends and other distributions in respect of the Escrow Shares) that accrue on the Escrow Amount during the period of time during which the Escrow Amount is held in the Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be part of the Escrow Fund; <i>provided, however</i>, that Buyer shall be required to report and pay the Taxes due on such interest, earnings and income, unless, and until, the Escrow Fund (or any portion thereof) is paid or released to Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Shares shall be appropriately adjusted for stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations and the like consummated by Buyer.</p><p>(b) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence through and until that date that is 365 days following the Closing Date (the “<i><strong>Escrow Period</strong></i>”). Upon the expiration of the Escrow Period, and within ten (10)&nbsp;business days thereafter, any and all Escrow Cash and/or Escrow Shares remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be released from the Escrow Fund to Seller after accounting for (i)&nbsp;all amounts theretofore validly distributed out of the Escrow Fund to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article&nbsp;IX and (ii)&nbsp;the retention of an amount of Escrow Cash and Escrow Shares equal, in the aggregate, to such portion of the remaining Escrow Fund which, subject to the objection of the Indemnifying Parties and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in a manner consistent with this Article&nbsp;IX, is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Damages Certificate (as defined in Section&nbsp;9.4(c)) delivered to the Indemnifying Parties prior to the end of the Escrow Period, which amount shall remain in the Escrow Fund (and the Escrow Fund shall remain in existence) until such claims have been resolved. As soon as such claims have been resolved (such resolution to be evidenced by the written agreement of Buyer and the Indemnifying Parties or the written decision of the arbitrators as described below), and within two (2)&nbsp;business days thereafter, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to Seller the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any remaining claims.</p><p>(c) In the event that any Indemnified Party has incurred or sustained Damages or reasonably anticipates that it will incur or sustain Damages, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Parties a certificate signed by any officer of the Indemnified Party (a “<i><strong>Damages Certificate</strong></i>”) (A)&nbsp;stating that the Indemnified Party has incurred or sustained Damages or reasonably anticipates that it could incur or sustain Damages and (B)&nbsp;specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Damages included, and a good faith estimate of the amount of such Damages, or the basis for such anticipated liability.</p><p>(d) The Indemnifying Parties shall have twenty (20)&nbsp;days following their receipt of a Damages Certificate to object to any claim or claims made in a Damages Certificate. In the event that the Indemnifying Parties have not objected within such twenty (20)&nbsp;day period to a Damages Certificate, then the Escrow Agent shall remit to the Indemnified Party an amount of Escrow Cash and a number of Escrow Shares that in the aggregate are equal to the amount set forth in such Damages Certificate and the Escrow Fund shall be reduced by such amount (it being agreed that (i)&nbsp;such remittance shall first be paid out of available Escrow Cash before Escrow Shares are used and (ii)&nbsp;the Escrow Shares shall be valued at a per share amount equal to</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-37-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>the closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on (A)&nbsp;if no Objection Certificate shall be delivered, the last day of the twenty (20)&nbsp;day period referred to in this Section&nbsp;9.4(d), (B)&nbsp;if an Objection Notice is delivered and the parties resolve such objection pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.4(e) within the fifteen (15)&nbsp;day period referred to in Section&nbsp;9.4(e), the last day of such fifteen (15)&nbsp;day period or (C)&nbsp;if an Objection Notice is delivered and the parties submit such objection to arbitration pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.4(e), the date of the arbitrator’s written decision referred to in Section&nbsp;9.4(e)) (as appropriately adjusted for Parent stock splits, recapitalizations, combinations and the like). In the event that the Indemnifying Parties so object within such twenty (20)&nbsp;day period, such objection must be in the form of a certificate signed by the Indemnifying Party or its authorized member or manager and delivered to the Indemnified Party (an “<i><strong>Objection Certificate</strong></i>”), which certificate shall set forth the item or items of Damages in the Damages Certificate to which the Indemnifying Parties are objecting and a reasonable basis for each such objection.</p><p>(e) For a period of fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the delivery of an Objection Certificate, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims as are objected to therein. If such an agreement is reached as to all or any portion of the Damages that are subject to the Objection Certificate, then a letter setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, where an Indemnified Party is entitled to be compensated from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such letter. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation during such 15-day period, either the Indemnifying Parties or the Indemnified Parties may make a written demand for arbitration of the matter no later than 30 days after the expiration of such 15-day period unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties. In the event that within 20 days after submission of any dispute to arbitration the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including reasonable legal fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim objected to in such Objection Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-38-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(f) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Austin, Texas, under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The payment of all fees and expenses of the parties to any such arbitration, as well as the fees of the arbitrator(s) and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, shall be payable in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.10.</p><p>9.5 Third Party Claims.</p><p>(a) In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party claim that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification hereunder (a “Third Party Claim”), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Parties of such claim, and the Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such claim; <i>provided, however</i>, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Parties shall relieve the Indemnifying Parties from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Parties are thereby prejudiced.</p><p>(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section&nbsp;9.5(a) above, the Indemnifying Parties will have the right to defend any Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of their choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party if (A)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party is negligently conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim or (B)&nbsp;so long as (i)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Parties notify the Indemnified Party in writing within 30 business days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Parties provide the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Parties will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill their indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii)&nbsp;the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief against Buyer or any successor-in-interest of Buyer to the Profiler Business, (iv)&nbsp;settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Buyer or any successor-in-interest of Buyer to the Profiler Business, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice that could be materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party (such materiality in its good faith judgment), and (v)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Parties are not negligent in their conduct of the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Parties will not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter into any settlement agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such judgment or settlement includes a full release of the Indemnified Party in respect of all indemnifiable Damages resulting therefrom, related thereto or arising therefrom.</p><p>(c) In the event any of the conditions in Section&nbsp;9.5(b)(B) above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Parties in connection therewith), (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Parties will</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-39-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), and (iii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article&nbsp;IX; <i>provided, however</i>, that notwithstanding anything contained in this Section&nbsp;9.5(c), the Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in, but not determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim.</p><p>9.6 Escrow Agent’s Duties.</p><p>(a) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Buyer and an officer of Seller.</p><p>(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the Parties hereto or by any other Person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.</p><p>(c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.</p><p>(d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.</p><p>(e) The Escrow Agent may resign as Escrow Agent at any time with or without cause by giving at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days’ prior written notice to each of Buyer, Seller and the Shareholders, such resignation to be effective thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the date such notice is given. In addition, Buyer and Seller may jointly remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without cause, by an instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the Escrow Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal. In the event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow agent which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000, shall be jointly appointed by Buyer and Seller in writing. Any such successor escrow agent shall deliver to Buyer, Seller and the Shareholders a written instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder and shall be entitled to receive the Escrow Fund. Thereafter, the predecessor Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liabilities under this Agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-40-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(f) In performing any duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible if acting in good faith for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent’s duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any Party to this Agreement.</p><p>(g) If any controversy arises between the Parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent shall await the arbitrators’ decision as specified in Section&nbsp;9.4(e) and act to make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with such decision.</p><p>(h) Buyer, Seller and the Shareholders and their respective successors and assigns, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement.</p><p>(i) All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid one-half (1/2)&nbsp;by Buyer and one-half (1/2)&nbsp;by Seller in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent as set forth on Exhibit M hereto. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if an controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is a made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys’ fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or ligitation.</p><p>(j) Any extraordinary fees and expenses, including any fees or expenses (including the fees or expenses of outside counsel to the Escrow Agent) incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with a dispute over the distribution of Escrow Amount or the validity of a Damages Certificate or Objection Certificate shall, unless otherwise ordered by the applicable arbitrator, be paid 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer within ten (10)&nbsp;days of receipt of a written invoice from Escrow Agent accompanied by evidence of a written invoice for such fees and expenses received by Escrow Agent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-41-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ARTICLE&nbsp;X</strong></p><p><strong>[INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]</strong></p><p><strong>ARTICLE&nbsp;XI</strong></p><p><strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p><p>11.1 Notices.&nbsp;All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a)&nbsp;when delivered personally, (b)&nbsp;on the fifth business day after being mailed by certified mail (return receipt requested), (c)&nbsp;the next business day after delivery to a recognized overnight courier or (d)&nbsp;upon the first business day after the transmission and confirmation of receipt by a facsimile operator if sent by facsimile, to the parties at the following addresses or facsimile numbers (or to such other address or facsimile number as such party for a party as shall be specified by like notice):</p><p>(a) if to Buyer, to:</p><p>SolarWinds, Inc.</p><p>3711 South MoPac Expressway</p><p>Building Two</p><p>Austin, Texas 78746</p><p>Attention: Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel</p><p>Facsimile No.: (512)&nbsp;857-0190</p><p>Telephone No.: (512)&nbsp;682-9300</p><p><i>with a copy to:</i></p><p>Wilson Sonsini Goodrich&nbsp;&amp; Rosati, Professional Corporation</p><p>900 South Capital of Texas Highway</p><p>Las Cimas IV, Fifth Floor</p><p>Austin, Texas 78746</p><p>Attention: Paul R.

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant</p><p>documentation. The parties each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-46-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>[Signature pages follow.]</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-47-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IN WITNESS WHEREOF,</strong> the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><strong>BUYER:</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">SOLARWINDS, INC.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>By:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>/s/ Kevin B.
